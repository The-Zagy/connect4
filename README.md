## Game Rules

6 * 7 => 6 rows 7 columns

 A B C D E F G
1
2
3
4

6


can place token any where but need to take gravity in mind 

example you can't insert token into A5 if A6 is empty instead you need to insert it in A6 first

don't fuck with the player in that just do the gravity yourself

if there's 4 in a row they win the game => A5 B4 c3 d2
